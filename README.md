Essay on the Software Engineering

Please note, your research questions should focus on *ONE* of these themes:

* Engineering for Accessibility
* Engineering for Portability
* Engineering for Localisation
* Specialist Algorithms and their Integration into Game Architectures

Please ensure that you reference appropirate academic literature and ensure that the discussion incorporates appropriate reference to key engineering principles and practices. Apply what you have learned into your collaborative game.

Localisation of software has the capacity to pose many a challenge to developers, as there are so many factors and small details that come into play, with systems such as menu systems and character interaction (in the context of video games) needing to be completely overhauled depending on the local, with dialect and alphabet used there "@inproceedings{hogan2004key" sometimes differing massively, these "Internationalisation Standards" have to be followed by the developer if they want their software to be understandable and acceptable in the local they are adapting it for. So my research question is this, "What problems do Internationalisation Standards pose to the localisation of software, and how can the engineering of said software be adapted to overcome them?, to address this question I will utilise my research into this topic area and synthesise this research into a cohesive whole and discuss how engineering processes can be changed or modified, if at all, to improve the development time and quality of the localisation, while still abiding by the standards that are set, and creating a more accessible and better received end product.
